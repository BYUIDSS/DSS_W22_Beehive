## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
brand_info <- read.csv("brand_info.csv")
core_poi <- read.csv("core_poi-patterns.csv")
home_panel <- read.csv("home_panel_summary.csv")
normalization <- read.csv("normalization_stats.csv")
vist_panel <- read.csv("visit_panel_summary.csv")
```

```{r}
View(core_poi)
View(vist_panel)
View(normalization)



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
